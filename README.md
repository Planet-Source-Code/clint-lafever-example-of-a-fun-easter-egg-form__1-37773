## Example of a fun Easter Egg Form


</div>

### Description

I am a guy who still loves the tradition of putting easter eggs in programs. I know some think they are a waste of code but hey, they are a fun way of letting a developer personalize his work. The form in this demo is just a fun example of one that I added to one of my projects. I just thought I would share something simple like this. Maybe it will give some others some insiration to make other egg type forms. I always likes to keep it simple myself. If too much is done in an egg, you may bring bugs or extra undue size to your product. This demo will also show how to play a WAV in a LOOP from the resource file (even though there are tons of examples of that here).
